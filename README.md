# Pomodoro for Xmonad

See <https://github.com/dattanchu/pymodoro> and specifically
<https://github.com/dattanchu/pymodoro/issues/46>. This program
doesn't have this issue, but probably others â€” drop me a line.
Instead, it's far less configurable. Most things that can be
changed for pymodoro can (and should) be changed in the source
file `pomodoro.c`. Good luck.
